python will take input as a string by default 

python rounds off the number to its lowest whole form

string concat can be done using " + " string

check strings.py for more info 

strings are immuatable, for example when we use string_name.lower() method, the existing string is not changed but a whole new string is created.

strings are immutable, i.e stored strings cannot be edited or changed, but a new modified string will be created.
